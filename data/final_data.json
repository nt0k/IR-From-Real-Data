    "title": "Milky Way Versus Andromeda As Seen from Earth",
    "channel": "SpaceRip",
    "description": "From HubbleCast. Scientists have been using Hubble observations to predict the future of the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way, and how the collision will look from Earth. Projecting the motion of Andromeda's stars over the next 8 billion years, the astronomers now know the path that galaxy is taking through space. And it's heading straight for us! Computer simulations based on Hubble observations show how the two galaxies will crash together in around 4 billion years' time.\n\n\nThe Andromeda Galaxy, some 2.2 million light-years away, is the closest spiral galaxy to our home, the Milky Way. For around a century, astronomers have known it is moving towards us, but whether or not the two galaxies would actually collide, or simply fly past each other, remained unclear. Now, a team of astronomers has used the Hubble Space Telescope to shed light on this question, by looking at the motion stars in the Andromeda Galaxy.\n\nWe wanted to figure out how Andromeda was moving through space. So in order to do that we measured the location of the Andromeda stars relative to the background galaxies. In 2002 they were in one place, and in 2010 they were in a slightly different place. And that allowed us to measure the motion over a period of eight years.\n\nThe motion is actually incredibly subtle, and not obvious to the human eye, even when looking at Hubble's sharp images. However, sophisticated image analysis revealed tiny movements that the scientists were able to project into the future.\n\nBased on these findings, it is finally possible to show what will happen to the Milky Way over the next eight billion years, as the galaxies drift closer, then collide and gradually merge into a single, larger, elliptical galaxy with reddish stars. And yet the Solar System should in fact survive this huge crash.\n\nThe reason we think that our Solar System will not be much affected by this collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda is that galaxies are mostly empty space.\nEven though our galaxy, as well as the Andromeda Galaxy, has a hundred billion stars in it, they are very far apart. So if two galaxies actually collide with each other, the stars basically pass right between each other and the chance of two stars directly hitting each other is really, really small. So the likelihood that our Solar System will be directly impacted by another star, for example, in Andromeda as we collide with it is really, really small.\n\nWell, if life is still present on Earth when this happens, the changes in the sky will be quite spectacular. Now they will be very very slow because the timescales on the scales of galaxies in the Universe are very very long. So you have to think, millions of years but even then over these timescales over millions of years, we will see big changes. If we wait a few billion years, Andromeda will be huge on the sky. It will be as big as our Milky Way because we'll be very close to it. \n\nAnd then later, when the galaxies merge, the merged remnant of the Milky Way Galaxy and Andromeda will look more like an elliptical galaxy and we'll be sitting right in it.\nSo the view of the Milky Way on the night sky will be completely gone and this band of light will be replaced by a more spheroidal distribution of light.\n\nAnd so, the Sun, born in the Milky Way almost 5 billion years ago will end its life in a new orbit, as part of a new galaxy.",

Use the \"silent saw trick\" for those deposit boxes, if that happens.\n---\n#PAYDAY2 #BigBank #UltimateStealthGuide\n---\nRecorded with: GeForce Experience\nEdited with: Vegas Pro 12.0\nGame version: December 17th, 2020 patch (Update 201.1)",

I used the Dolphin emulator to slow down the game and enter in precise inputs frame by frame. \n\nMade on Dolphin 5.0-12247\n\nRerecord count: 5,764\n\nFinal time (RTA): 5:29.250\n\nThis project began on July 24th and ended on August 9th upon completion of the TAS.\n\nThanks to:\n\nSir_Tyler: Assistance developing strategies and choosing optimal winds for each hole\nTheRoadRunner: Hole 1 set up and other strategies\nKiwi: TAS tips/tricks\n\nFAQ:\n\nWhy?\n\nGive Up% is a popular Wii Sports speedrunning category. Giving up a hole is the only other way to complete a hole, and in some cases it is actually useful to use it in a normal speedrun of golf. The World Record as of the publishing of this video is 5:58.47 by TheRoadRunner, which you can watch here: https://youtu.be/vrk_reVVYAs\n\nWhy did you miss your first putt into the river on Hole 6?\n\nThat putt intentionally approached the very edge of the river so that all of the rest of the putts would be faster. It actually didn't waste any strokes, because on any par 4 you can do 5 Out of Bound shots and 1 In-Bound or 6 OOB shots and either way will get you Give Up. A similar strategy was used on Hole 1 and 7, where instead the first shot was just used to land the ball somewhere where getting OOBs was faster.\n\nWhy did your first shot not go OOB on Hole 3?\n\nIt would have saved a stroke to hit all of the shots OOB, but there wasn't any set up we could find that is faster than setting up the first shot right next to the OOB grass. You could hit all your shots straight out into the OOB barrier, but it is quite far away and requires you to turn over on every single shot, whereas if you land next to the OOB grass, you can just putt straight forwards.",

It's the ultimate party tune, that creates an uncontrollable urge to rock.  This song and many others by AC/DC is truly the definition of rock and roll. ACDC is a band that truly exemplifies every element of rock.  they are rock and roll personified.  In this video we celebrate this iconic song from the second biggest selling album in the world, Back in Black. With the  irrepressible Angus Young, who detonates a face melting, heart rupturing guitar solo that's become the stuff of legend and although there will only be one Bon Scott, the vocal performance by Brian Johnson on \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" effectively began his legacy as one of the most distinctive rock vocalists of all time.  With an appearance by Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads who relates a hilarious story about the band, this is a must see episode.\n\nHey Music Junkies Professor of Rock always here to celebrate the greatest songs and the greatest artists of all time with the vinyl community.  If you are all about the music, subscribe below also if you want to help us continue to curate the history of these artists and their songs click on our patreon link below ALRIGHT It's time for another episode of #1 in our hearts where we celebrate a song that should've been a number one hit but for various reasons it came up short BUT IN our hearts and in our minds it is number one with a bullet. \n\nThen the roller coaster fell to the band's NAYDEAR in February, 1980, when their beloved & rebellious front man Bon Scott was found dead in the back of a friend's car in London after a heavy night of partying. The official cause of Scott's death was classified as \"alcohol poisoning\" and \"death by misadventure\". The loss of Bon was devastating, and the band seriously contemplated breaking up. They had lost, not only their charismatic front man, but also their primary lyricist over 7 studio albums.     Bon's close friends & family, particularly Bon's father, strongly encouraged the band to find a new lead singer, and forge ahead. Bon's father said it is \"what Bon would've wanted.\" The band decided that they would actively pursue a new singer following Bon's funeral. \n\nThe auditions began to find a replacement for Bon Scott, and there were some notable candidates that vied for the gig, including Noddy Holder from Slade, who reportedly, was offered the job and turned it down. During the auditions, Malcolm & Angus remembered Bon mentioning a singer that he was really impressed with named Brian Johnson who was the front man for a band called Geordie, that he saw perform in London in the mid-70s. \n\nBon told the brothers that he saw this guy named Brian Johnson, and how great he was. Bon described watching Brian writhing on the stage floor, kicking and screaming while the crowd went nuts. Brian Johnson remembered the night when Bon saw him perform very well, because the reason he was on the floor of the stage was not part of the act, it was because he was suffering from a vicious appendicitis attack, and rather than rushing off stage to the hospital like most performers would have done, Johnson kept singing- essentially, waling in agony. \n\nAll of the remaining AC/DC crew, and producer Mutt Lange, wanted Brian to be their new lead singer. To Brian's surprise, they offered him the gig, he happily accepted, and the band made the official announcement on April 1, 1980, that Brian Johnson was the new lead singer of AC/DC. Billboard Breakdown.\n\nThe band's bumpy ride reached its pinnacle in July, 1980, when they released 'Back in Black', a historic LP that not only overtook Highway to Hell as the band's best selling album, it would go on to become the 2nd biggest selling album of all time, selling an estimated 50 million copies around the world- 2nd only to Michael Jackson's Thriller.   With Mutt Lange at the helm the album was meticulously produced.  Mutt Lang's attention to detail and perfectionism is of course the stuff of Legend.  I was interviewing Jerry Harrison who at the time was with Talking Heads recording in the same studio.",

This means you CANNOT jailbreak iOS 13.5.1 NOR can you jailbreak iOS 13.6 with this version of unc0ver. This is because Apple closed the main exploit used to jailbreak with the release of iOS 13.5.1. You'll need to WAIT for a new jailbreak to drop (this could take a while). In the meantime, don't update to new versions of iOS 13 (like iOS 13.5.1, iOS 13.6, iOS 13.6.1, iOS 13.6.1, etc.) when they're released. STAY WHERE YOU ARE! \n\nThankfully, this jailbreak supports A9 - A12 and A13. This means you can jailbreak EVERY iOS 13 device, even the latest ones like the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPad Pro 2018, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, etc. This is a semi untethered iOS 13 jailbreak! Meaning you won't need a computer to re-enable your jailbreak! Just open the app on your device and tap \"jailbreak\" to re-enable your iOS 13-13.5 jailbreak. In fact, you can even jailbreak without a computer completely, even if the developer enterprise certificate is revoked (see video for details). \n\n---  ---  --- --- iOS 13.5 Jailbreak Coverage ---  ---  --- --- \n\n\u25b6\ufe0e  Jailbreak iOS 13.5 Tutorial with Unc0ver:\nhttps://youtu.be/GPydFtPUrog\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e  Jailbreak iOS 13.5.1 with Checkra1n for OLD Devices: \nhttps://youtu.be/2ngexawBQ0g\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e  Best Essential Cydia Tweaks Once Jailbroken: \nhttps://youtu.be/wjMrymse8Do\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e  Top 100+ iOS 13.5 Tweaks Once Jailbroken: \nhttps://youtu.be/WH2EHwKnG58\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e  Best Paid iOS 13.5 Jailbreak Tweaks:\nhttps://youtu.be/r5JiPWjPlB4\n\n---  ---  --- --- End of  Useful Stuff ---  ---  --- ---  \n\n** YouTube: Jailbreaking is 100% legal under the DMCA.

I used the Dolphin emulator to slow down the game and enter in precise inputs frame by frame. \n\nRerecord count: 7,598\n\nThis project began in September 2018 after I started speedrunning Wii Sports golf, and ended in December 2018 upon completion of the TAS.\n\nFAQ:\n\nWhy did you enter Expert a few times before starting the run?\n\nThe first time was to clear the AB check before the run got started, and the second was to generate new RNG values for the wind. I need certain winds on some holes or else it is impossible to play them optimally.\n\nWhy didn't you get a hole in one on Hole 7?\n\nSpeaking of getting optimal winds... I tried to, but the wind and pin placement made it impossible. Trust me, I tried many ways to get it to work, but it wasn't going to happen. It cost about 2-3 seconds to land in the bunker and get an eagle.\n\nWhy are some of the swings kinda slow?\n\nI had to TAS this using emulated motion controls, meaning an x,y,z coordinate for every single frame to emulate the position of the wiimote. The best solution I found for fast swings resulted in some swings taking a brief moment to adjust before the ball could be hit.\n\nSpeedrun.com leaderboard: https://www.speedrun.com/wiisports#Golf_9_Holes\n\nWii Sports discord: https://discord.gg/ryhWwTv",

At the early tiers you don't have access to dive bombers.  Fighters are great at defending capital ships from torpedo and dive bombing attacks and also hunting down other enemy planes.  Torpedo bombers require a bit of planning and skill, but can unleash a 6 torpedo attack run on enemy ships that can have a dramatic result on the battle.  Currently there are only 4 classes in WOWS; destroyers, cruisers, battleships and aircraft carriers.  Aircraft carriers use a top down, Real Time Strategy (RTS) style of gameplay which is fun and unique to World of Warships. \n\nThanks for watching!\n-Baron",

Thank you!\n\nBattle royale games are played between a large number of individual players, or a number of small squads (typically up to four or five players). In each match, the goal is to be the last player or last team standing by eliminating all other opponents. A match starts by placing the player-characters into a large map space, which may have random distribution or allow players to have some control of where they start. All players start with minimal equipment, giving no player an implicit advantage at the onset, though games allow players to customize the appearance of their character. Randomly scattered around the map are weapons, armor, vehicles, and other items that are beneficial for combat and survival. Players need to search the map for these items while avoid being killed by other players. Equipment from eliminated players can be looted as well. The \"safe area\" of the map decreases in size around a randomly selected point throughout the match, forcing surviving players into closer quarters and increasing the chance of player encounters.\n\nSNOWBALL RIDING | Fortnite Best Moments #9 (Fortnite Funny Fails & WTF Moments) (Battle Royale)",

    "description": "Please leave a 'Like' to show us which runs you enjoy most. Run starts at 05:45.  #151,  played by PEACHES_  ((http://www.twitch.tv/peaches__)\nTime 0:22:22\nCategory - 16-Star, 1-handed\n\u00a9 2014  SDA\nCouch commentators: \n\nReleased in September 1996, Mario 64 launched the Nintendo 64 to awes of the new 3D game play. Mario gets new moves in the 3D world such as a wall jump and triple jump which he uses on his journey to collect 120 power stars, which Bowser has sealed away inside the castle paintings. A DS remake was released on November 21, 2004. Instead of just playing as Mario, this time, Mario, Luigi and Wario are now trapped. You start off with Yoshi and save your allies in their own portraits. In place of the original analog controls, players can either use the D-Pad or the Touch screen. Other additions include: 150 Stars in total, Wireless Multiplayer, and Touch Screen Minigames to increase its lifespan. Source: http://speeddemosarchive.com/Mario64.html\n\nAt this past Awesome Games Done Quick, $1,025,000 was raised for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. It only took a week of continuous streaming, 18,000 donors, and many many runners to achieve. A big thanks to everyone responsible for these amazing numbers, what a humbling achievement. For comparison, last year's event raised just under $500,000. \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nFollow SDA on Twitter https://twitter.com/SDAspeedruns \nYoutube playlist for AGDQ 2014 http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMNeTFVQZEQNOKx55mGOeTWdGSg0ywDHw\nSee SDA on Twitch http://www.twitch.tv/speeddemosarchivesda\n\nSee all runs from SGDQ 2013 http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMNeTFVQZEQOk-fVeyPAd2kyqQDjhYm8w&feature=mh_lolz\nGet a text message every time a video is uploaded http://motube.us/SpeedDemosArchiveSDA\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDownload AGDQ 2014 https://archive.org/details/AwesomeGamesDoneQuick2014\n\nDownload SGDQ 2013 http://archive.org/details/SummerGamesDoneQuick2013\nSGDQ 2013 Highlight reel http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGcp6l67qiU&feature=youtu.be\nSGDQ 2013 Blooper Reel http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFFnk045iO8&feature=youtu.be\n\nUraniumAnchor's channel (guy who made the highlight/blooper reels for AGDQ/SGDQ 2013).

    "channel": "xTyler73",
    "description": "UPDATE 2019: I've used YouTube's live edit feature to remove the out of date parts, so this video is now entirely up to date and still very useful!\n0:00 - If you open doors in the buildings on the spawn island, they'll be open for you when you take a boat there. This saves you time when looting there\n\n0:26 - Pressing C will make you dive in water, and SPACEBAR will make you rise, this is easier than moving your mouse all the way down or up\n\n0:37 - You can start moving when the healing item you're using is at 0.5 seconds left and it will still be used. This works whether you're on foot or in a car\n\n1:06 - Dropping healing items as bait is a good way to trick people into thinking an area or house is not looted and therefore clear\n\n1:56 - If an enemy sees you, they will most likely change their movement pattern or take a longer time to do something than normal\n\n2:23 - If you're shooting an enemy and they take cover behind an object, keep shooting around that object so that they think they have the angle wrong and take cover on the wrong side of the object. Especially useful if you have a silencer\n\n2:52 - Change the inventory key from TAB to any other button, so that you can sprint and look at your inventory without bringing up Steam's SHIFT TAB menu, or so that you can look around with ALT and look at your inventory without ALT TABBING\n\n3:10 - Clicking and holding when you shoot a sniper will keep you scoped in, allowing you to see exactly where your bullet hit\n\n3:36 - If you shoot your sniper and instantly change weapons, the next round won't be chambered in your sniper. Tap left click or do a full reload to chamber the next bullet\n\n4:36 - If you hold CTRL while dragging an item into your inventory, it will automatically type in the max amount you can carry. Right clicking also works. Also, ammo loaded into your magazine doesn't take up inventory space\n\n4:56 - All levels of vests give a capacity boost of +50, so upgrading your level of vest doesn't increase the amount of items you can carry\n\n5:07 - If you have to exit your car to take a fight, you can press CTRL + 2 or CTRL + 4 to switch to the passenger side of the car so that when you exit you can use your own car as cover\n\n5:52 - By holding down SPACEBAR, SHIFT and W you can spin the wheels on your car, and then when you let go of SPACEBAR you'll accelerate faster than if you just pressed SHIFT and W. Most useful if you're waiting for your teammates to get in the car or waiting for an item to be used\n\n6:37 - White line to white line on the map is 100m, so diagonally across a white line box is 140m. Yellow line to yellow line is 1000m. Knowing this makes zeroing shots easier\n\n6:53 - Going prone with the M249 reduces the recoil to almost none, and this makes destroying cars very easy\n\n7:14 - Grenades equipped in the bottom right of your inventory won't show up on the left side of your inventory, so you if you just look on the left side it won't give you your true grenade count\n\n7:33 - Going into first person can sometimes help you see the plane or crates easier\n\n7:42 - Use alt to look around when you're hiding in a bush or grass, so that your whole player model doesn't rotate (which makes you really visible to other players)\n\n7:57 - You can throw grenades into the little huts through the tiny windows\n\n8:04 - Level 3 bags obtained from crates have a unique, leafy camouflage look to them\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n01/02/2019 Changelog, edited out the following tips as they're now out of date: \n\nDon't spam bandages, time them so that you use a new one on third tick of the previous one. (You can now spam them)\n\nPressing CTRL + U will disable your teammates death icon if it's blocking your shot. (The death icon will dynamically fade now if you aim over it, but CTRL + U still disables all HUD)\n\nYou can jump higher than normal by pressing JUMP, CROUCH, and W all at the same time (Vaulting now exists)\n\nDon't switch weapons when throwing grenades, and always commit to the throw even if you have to throw it away so that you don't die (Was a bug, now they are safely working as intended)\n\nAll grenades have a 5 second timer, so do a mental countdown from 5 when cooking grenades (You have to cook them with the R key, also stun grenades are 2.5 seconds)\n\nYou can grab items while jumping by quickly dragging them into your inventory (A small delay has been added, so you can't do this)\n\nAll cars spawn in facing east with their backlights out, and all boast spawn in facing west. In order to turn off the backlights, you need to jump out of your car when it's still moving at a slow speed (Cars now spawn in facing a random direction)\n\nYou can delete the file LoadingScreen.mp4 at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\PUBG\\TslGame\\Content\\Movies \nand you'll load into the game faster [thanks /u/Dakstar] (The file structure is changed and you can't delete this anymore)",

    "channel": "BigBossBilly",
    "description": "PU$$Y STRATS espisode 4 out now: https://youtu.be/6EOLqE5hIuc\n\nTired of choosing between low-risk, low-reward and high-risk, high-reward dropping strategies in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds? This new strategy has the best of both worlds. It's a tactic that has low risk of early dying, but a high chance of getting some good kills and good gear.\n\nIt's basically a looting guide with one specific route, but you can use the same strategy in other locations on the map. The strategy relies on dropping at a small compound NEAR a very highly contested loot spot, it could be anywhere such as prison, school, Hospital, or Mansion. Just get a rifle from a nearby building, lie in wait for the \"winner\" of the highly contested area to show himself, kill him, and take his loot. Even if this specific route doesn't work for you, use the general tactic elsewhere on the map. \n\n\nCheck it out and let me know if you like it!\n\nSee Pablo dressed as Olaf the Snowman at our winter Lan party: https://youtu.be/wU-z2jZlysI?t=54s\n\nMy Gaming PC Build: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXwmCLPqIzM\n\nThanks for making this video go viral!",
